        "### Summary  \n",
        "This colab provides an introduction to 'Genetic algorythms'. The Genetic algorythm is an adaptive heuristic search algorithm. This module will explain how the genetic algorythm can be applied to handle a famous combinatorial optimization problem: the one of the 'traveling salesman'.  \n",
