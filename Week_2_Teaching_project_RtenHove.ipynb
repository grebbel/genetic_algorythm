        "### Summary  \n",
        "This module provides an introduction to 'Genetic algorithms'. The Genetic algorithm is an adaptive heuristic search algorithm. In this module it will be explained how the genetic algorithm can be applied to handle a famous combinatorial optimization problem: the one of the '*traveling salesman*'.  \n",
        "The module **Genetic Algorithm for the Travelling Salesman** prepares you for the next module '*Advancing in Genetic Alogorithms*'.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Target Learner \n",
        "The TARGET LEARNER of this module is the curious Biologist who's heard about **Genetic Algorithms**, and: \n",
        "1.   Wants to know what it is, \n",
        "2.   How to employ it to solve the traveling salesman problem, \n",
        "3.   Wants to calculate the shortest route, for example between the sample collection sites.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Prerequisite skills \n",
        "You are a Biologist with basic Python programming skills. No advanced mathematical training is required to complete this module successfully. The goal is to whet your appetite for using Genetic Algorithms in your work as a Biologist.   \n",
